# Basic Computer Vision Operations: Blurring, Edge Detection, Thresholding, and Contours

This section introduces some of the most fundamental computer vision techniques. These operations build directly on the concepts of pixels, grayscale, and RGB channels.

## Blurring
Blurring reduces image detail and noise, helping highlight larger patterns.

## Edge Detection
Edge detection identifies boundaries within an image, making shapes and structures stand out.

## Thresholding
Thresholding converts an image into black-and-white regions, useful for segmentation.

## Contour Detection
Contours trace the outlines of shapes, enabling a computer to recognize and analyze forms.
